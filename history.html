            <!--explanation of the history-->
            <p>1521, Ferdinand Magellan arrived and claimed the islands for Spain. For more than 300 years, the Philippines was under Spanish rule. The Spanish brought Christianity, built churches, and created towns. They introduced new systems of government, education, and trade. Many Filipinos were converted to Catholicism, which became a major part of Filipino culture and identity.</p>
            <p>However, Spanish rule also brought forced labor, heavy taxes, and social inequality. Filipino natives had limited rights and were often treated unfairly. Over time, resentment grew among the people. Many Filipinos fought for freedom, leading to revolts and uprisings across the country. In the late 1800s, Filipino nationalists such as José Rizal, Andres Bonifacio, and Emilio Aguinaldo inspired the movement for independence. Their efforts led to the Philippine Revolution against Spanish rule.</p>

            <img src="media/american.jpeg" alt="American Period in the Philippines">
            <p>After the Spanish-American War in 1898, Spain surrendered the Philippines to the United States through the Treaty of Paris. Although Filipinos had already declared independence, the Americans took control of the islands, starting a new period of colonization.</p>
            <p>The Americans introduced public education, building schools and teaching English as the main language. They also improved transportation, health care, and government systems, which helped modernize the country. Democratic ideas such as freedom, equality, and self-governance began to spread among Filipinos.</p>
            <p>However, many Filipinos wanted full independence, leading to the Philippine-American War (1899–1902). Thousands of Filipinos died fighting for freedom, but eventually, the Philippines remained under American rule. In 1935, the United States allowed the creation of the Commonwealth of the Philippines, led by President Manuel L. Quezon, as preparation for full independence. During World War II, Japan invaded the Philippines in 1941, causing great destruction and suffering. After the war ended, the Americans returned and helped rebuild the nation.</p>

            <p>On July 4, 1946, the Philippines finally became an independent nation after years of foreign rule.

            <p>Since gaining independence, the Philippines has faced many challenges such as political issues, economic struggles, and natural disasters. Despite these difficulties, the country has continued to grow, rebuild, and modernize over time. Filipinos have shown great resilience, unity, and faith in overcoming hardships.</p>
            <p>The nation has become more involved in global affairs, building relationships with other countries and joining international organizations. Today, the Philippines is known for its rich culture, strong family values, creativity, and love for freedom. The Filipino people continue to take pride in their heritage, language, and traditions, while embracing progress and change in the modern world.</p>
